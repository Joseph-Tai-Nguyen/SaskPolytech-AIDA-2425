It was much helpful for me as I am too new for power apps . Before my internship gets over ( in next 5 days ) i have to make a attendance app for the factory employees.

Or they can executed  on the offline mode... within LAN that have  installed web server for example... and does Power Apps suppprt for emcrypted data transmission like AES256 so on... thanks for cool teaching...\n","\n","21 ) Thank you Kevin .. for  doing great video tutorials!

Way to go microsoft - nothing new, not any better than previous methods, but now there&#39;s more &quot;training&quot; - what a waste of time.\n","\n","26 ) I can&#39;t access to power apps. For the 30 days free trial it ask me for a professional account. When I login to my microsoft account, the power apps is not in the application list. Probably I need a different kind of account. Could you help me?\n","\n","27 ) Excellent video! Please make a video using more of the button options such as conditionals, and etc...\n","\n","28 ) :)\n","\n","29 ) I think I would have started by showing the completed app and then show how its created.

Thanks\n","\n","39 ) awesome as always, thanks Kev :) Could you please make a video about power apps copilot and how to get it?

I&#39;m sure, it&#39;s simple but it just doesn&#39;t click.<br>The app will be needed to standardize information about sensors.<br>All i want the app to do is:<br>1. Select (or add) the customer<br>THEN<br>2. Select (or add) a project with that selected customer<br>3. Add sensors<br>4. Add sensor information like location, time of calibration, etc.<br><br>I think i need more than 1 data source but i don&#39;t know how to implement it...<br><br>Can you help me?\n","\n","42 ) This was very informative for a beginner such as myself.

This is very useful.\n","\n","54 ) Excellent\n","\n","55 ) Demo showing vaguely useful use case would be nice, how many times do we create screens with a fixed message on them, showing how to tie in to data of the other page and linkage of the app to its data source is fundamental but completley ignored.\n","\n","56 ) I learned SO much just now!!!
